`m_greentext.so` -- automagic greentext for InspIRCd
====================================================

`m_greentext.so` is a module for [InspIRCd](http://www.inspircd.org)
v.2.x, which adds a `+E` channel mode. When set, channel messages
prefixed with `>` will automatically be coloured green, sparing users
the tedium of adding such control codes themselves.

Unfortunately, due to the highly nuanced IRC protocol, you will not be
able to see your own greentext stories in their true form.

`m_greentext.so` is dedicated to Lennart Poettering, in recognition of
his unifying contributions to Free Software.

`m_greentext.so` is distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License version 2. Violations will be aggressively litigated.
